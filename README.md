This project is a **top-down shooter AI system** built with Unity, designed for developers who want to learn about AI movement, automatic shooting mechanics, enemy management, and health bar logic in game development.

---

## Features

- **Player Movement**
  - The player character moves across the map using Unity's NavMeshAgent.
  - Movement is controlled by mouse clicks, making navigation intuitive and responsive.

- **Enemy AI**
  - Enemies spawn randomly on the map at regular intervals.
  - Each enemy is programmed to pursue the player using basic AI pathfinding.

- **Automatic Shooting System**
  - The player automatically detects enemies using raycasting and fires bullets without manual input.
  - Bullets are visualized with trail effects for a dynamic and engaging shooting experience.

- **Health Bar System**
  - Each enemy has a health bar that updates in real-time as it takes damage.
  - Health bars provide immediate feedback to players about enemy status.

- **Visual Effects**
  - Bullets leave trails for improved visual clarity and game feel.
  - Damage indicators and health bar changes make the game more immersive.
